### ðŸ›  Build and Run with Docker

**Build the Docker image and run:**
```

bash run_docker.sh
```

## ðŸ”¬ Experiments from the Paper

### Independence tests (permutationâ€‘based)
`applications/independence_test.py`  
Compares **UFDM** with **DCOR**, **HSIC**, and **MEF**.

### Feature extraction (linear representation learning)
`applications/feature_extraction_dim_selection.py`  
Compares **UFDM**, **DCOR**, **HSIC**, **MEF**, and **Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA)** for classification tasks.

> **Note:** Datasets for the featureâ€‘extraction experiments are downloaded automatically via the **OpenML API**.
