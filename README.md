Code repository for Uniform Fourier Dependence Measure (UFDM).

Working current paper draft (UFDM)[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360919080_Measuring_Statistical_Dependencies_via_Maximum_Norm_and_Characteristic_Functions].

Journal publication: TODO

Experiments performed in the paper:

applications/independence_test.py - permutation-based independence tests with UFDM, DCOR, HSIC, and MEF.

applications/feature_extraction_dim_selection.py - feature extraction (linear representation learning) for classification with UFDM, DCOR, HSIC, MEF and Neighborhood compoent analysis (NCA).

The data for feature extraction experiments is downloaded automatically via OpenML API.
